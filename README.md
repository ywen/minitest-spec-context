# Minitest::Spec::Context

This gem provides a ```context``` method for MiniTest::Spec

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'minitest-spec-context'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install minitest-spec-context

## Usage

Require the gem in the `test_helper`:

```ruby
require "minitest-spec-context"
```

And now you can use it:

```ruby

describe "#method" do
  context "when condition 1" do
    it "does something" do
      ...
    end
  end
  context "when condition 2" do
    it "does something else" do
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

The ```context``` method is available only in the nested blocks. One cannot use it in the outside most block. I simply do not desire to introduce a new method in ruby ```Kernel``` module
